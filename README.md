# GT-8-Floorboard
This is a branch off of the original GT-8-Floorboard written by Colin Willcocks.

I'm the only one using this branch, so if you're looking for the original source you have to check out
https://sourceforge.net/p/fxfloorboard/svn/HEAD/tree/branches/gt-8_ver-2/

All honors to Colin Willcocks for making this program. It's been a great help for everyone who uses the Boss GT-8 floorboard.

This repo is NOT a part of the original GT-8-Floorboard, so if you're looking for bugfixes etc, go to the aforementioned url.
